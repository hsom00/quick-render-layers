# quick-render-layers
Output a render for each layer within a composition without having to break composition out into smaller ones. Also allows user to encode their output as h.264. Handy for making proxies or slicing up regions of work into more managable parts. 

## To do
- Ask for AE script write-access
- Automatically remember previous settings 
- Add setting to automatically solo layers before render
- On first usage, give user ability to supply path to ffmpeg binary
